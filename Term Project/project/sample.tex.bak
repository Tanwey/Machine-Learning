\section{Introduction}

Sample complexity is one of the central concepts in machine learning. It is
the amount of data needed to achieve a desired learning accuracy. For example, in PAC-learning, sample complexity is characterized
by the VC dimension (VCD) of the concept class \citep{Vapnik1971On}. PAC-learning is a passive learning model. In this model, the role of the teacher is limited
to providing labels to data randomly drawn from the underlying distribution. Different from PAC-learning, there are important models in which teacher involves more actively
in the learning process. For example, in the classical teaching model \citep{goldman1995complexity}, the teacher chooses a set of labeled examples so that the learner,
after receiving the examples, can distinguish the target concept from all other concepts in the
concept class. In this model, the key complexity measure of a concept class is the teaching dimension,
which is defined as the worst-case number of examples needed to be selected by the teacher.

One of the most important questions in computational learning theory is how such information
complexity parameters relate to each other. An open problem is whether any
linear function of the VCD of a finite concept class gives an upper bound on the recursive teaching
dimension \citep{Zilles2013Models} of that class.

In this article, we will review related works in this topic and discuss about the challenges in fully solving the open problem.

\section{Definitions and Notation}

$X$ denotes a finite set¡£ Sometimes, for brevity, we let $ X = [n] := \{1,2,...,n\}$. A concept $C$ is a subset of $X$. $\mathcal{C}$ denotes a concept class over $X$, which is a subset of $2^{|X|}$. For $X' \subseteq X$, we define $\mathcal{C}_{|X'} := \{C \cap X' | C\in \mathcal{C}\}$. We treat concepts interchangeably
as subsets of $X$ and as 0,1-valued functions on $X$. A labeled example is a pair $(x,l)$ with
$x \in X$ and $l \in \{0, 1\}$. A labeled example $(x,l)$ is consistent with a concept $C$ if $\chi(x \in C) = l$. If $S$ is a set of labeled examples, we define $X(S) = \{x\in X|(x,*) \in S\}$.

$A \subseteq X$ is said to be shattered by $\mathcal{C}$ if $\mathcal{C}_{|A} = 2^{|A|}$. VCD($\mathcal{C}$) denotes the VC-dimension of a concept class $\mathcal{C}$, which is the maximum size of a shattered subset of $X$.

A teaching set for a concept $C \in \mathcal{C}$ is a set $S$ of labeled examples such that $C$, but no
other concept in $\mathcal{C}$, is consistent with $S$. Let $\mathcal{TS}(C;\mathcal{C})$ denote the family of teaching sets for
$C \in \mathcal{C}$, let ${TS}(C;\mathcal{C})$ denote the size of the smallest teaching set for $C \in \mathcal{C}$.

\begin{definition}[\citealt{Zilles2013Models}] A teaching plan $P$ for $\mathcal{C}$ is a sequence $((C_1,S_1),...,(C_N,S_N))$, such that $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,...,C_n\}$ and $\forall t = 1,2,...,N$, $S_t \in \mathcal{TS}(C_t;\{C_t,...,C_N\})$. The quantity ord($P$) $:= max_{t=1,...,N} |S_t|$ is called the order of the teaching plan $P$. Finally, we define recursive teaching dimension RTD($\mathcal{C}$) $:= min\{ord(P) |$ P is a teaching plan for $\mathcal{C}$\}.
\end{definition}

It is clear that RTD$(\mathcal{C})$ is monotonic. If $\mathcal{C}' \subseteq \mathcal{C}$, RTD$(\mathcal{C'})\leq$ RTD$(\mathcal{C})$. We have several propositions which can be used as equivalent definitions for recursive teaching dimension.

\begin{proposition}
$P$ is called a canonical teaching plan for $\mathcal{C}$, if for any $i, j \in \{1,...,N\}$, $i < j$, we have $TS(C_i;\{C_i,...,C_N\})\leq TS(C_j;\{C_i,...,C_N\})$. For a canonical teaching plan $P^*$, RTD$(\mathcal{C})$ $= ord(P^*)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For a canonical teaching plan $P^*$, it is clear that RTD($\mathcal{C}$) $\leq ord(P^*)$. We need to prove RTD($\mathcal{C}$) $\geq ord(P^*)$. Let $P^* = ((C_1,S_1),...,(C_N,S_N))$, and another teaching plan $P = ((C_1',S_1'),...,(C_N',S_N'))$. Choose the minimal $j$ such that $|S_j|=TS(C_j;\{C_j,...,C_N\})=ord(P^*)$. Choose the minimal $i$ such that $C_i' \in \{C_j,...,C_N\}$. So, $C_i'=C_k$ for some $k$. By the definition of canonical teaching plan, $TS(C_k;\{C_j,...,C_N\})\geq TS(C_j;\{C_j,...,C_N\})\geq ord(P^*)$. $ord(P)\geq TS(C_i';\{C_i',...,C_N'\}) \geq TS(C_k;\{C_j,...,C_N\}) \geq ord(P^*)$ hence finish the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
Let $TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}) := min_{C \in \mathcal{C}} TS(C;\mathcal{C})$. Then RTD$(\mathcal{C})= max_{\mathcal{C}' \subseteq \mathcal{C}} TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}')$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For a canonical teaching plan $P$, we have $TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}) = TS(C_1;\mathcal{C})$. It follows that RTD$(\mathcal{C})$ $ = max \{TS(C_1; \mathcal{C})$, RTD$(\mathcal{C} \backslash C_1)\}$ $ = max \{TS_{min}(\mathcal{C})$, RTD$(\mathcal{C}\backslash C_1)\}$. RTD$(\mathcal{C})$ $\leq max_{\mathcal{C}' \subseteq \mathcal{C}} TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}')$ follows inductively. As for the reverse direction, let $\mathcal{C}' \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ be the maximizer of $TS_{min}$. We have RTD$(\mathcal{C})\geq$ RTD$(\mathcal{C'})\geq TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}')= max_{\mathcal{C}' \subseteq \mathcal{C}} TS_{min}(\mathcal{C}')$
\end{proof}

The open problem under consideration is that whether RTD can be linear bounded by VCD.

\section{RTD for Special Classes}
The following families of concept classes $\mathcal{C}$ are known to have recursive teaching dimension of size equal or smaller than VCD($\mathcal{C}$).

\begin{definition} A concept class $\mathcal{C}$ of VC-dimension $d$ over $X$ of cardinality $n$ is called maximum classes if $\mathcal{C}$ achieved the Sauer's bound\citep{Sauer1972On}, $|\mathcal{C}|=\sum _{i=0}^d C^i_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} A concept class $\mathcal{C}$ is called intersection-closed if the intersection of any two concepts from $\mathcal{C}$ is itself a concept
in $\mathcal{C}$ as well.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a vector space of real-valued functions over some domain $X$ and $h : X \to R$. For every $f \in \mathcal{F}$, let $C_f(x)=1$ if $h(x)+f(x) > 0$, else $C_f(x)=0$. Then $D_{\mathcal{F},h} = \{C_f|f\in \mathcal{F}\}$ is called a Dudley class. The dimension of $D_{\mathcal{F},h}$ is
equal to the dimension of the vector space $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{definition}

In \citet{Darnstdt2016Order}, it has been proved that

\begin{theorem} For a concept class $\mathcal{C}$, if it is a maximum class, intersection-closed class or of VC-dimension 1, then RTD($\mathcal{C}$) = VCD($\mathcal{C}$). If it is a Dudley class, then RTD($\mathcal{C}$) $\leq$ VCD($\mathcal{C}$).
\end{theorem}

The first part of the proof involved explicit construction of a teaching plan or some compression schemes. However, for general concept classes, a explicit constrcution may be hard to find. For the Dudley class case, prove that Dudley classes of dimension $k$ are embeddable in maximum classes of VC-dimension $k$. It is not known to date whether every concept class C of VC-dimension $d$ can be embedded into a maximum concept class of VC-dimension $O(d)$. Indeed, finding such an embedding is considered as a promising method for solving the open problem.

\section{Quadratic Upper Bound of RTD}

In the paper of , they proved first bound for general concept class. Let $f(d)=max_{\mathcal{C}:VCD(\mathcal{C})\leq d}TS_{min}(\mathcal{C})$. They used the method in and to prove that $f(d)\leq 2^d(d+1)+1 + f(d-1)$ and $f(d)\leq 2^{d+1}(d-2)+d+4$.
